This repository contains various AI-based algorithms and implementations. Each assignment focuses on a key area of artificial intelligence, providing hands-on experience with important concepts like search algorithms, game strategies, and logical reasoning.

1. Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for 8-Puzzle Problem
Implemented DFS and BFS algorithms to solve the 8-puzzle problem. The algorithms explore different possible moves to reach the goal state from an initial configuration.

2. Constraint Satisfaction Problem
This implementation solves a constraint satisfaction problem by exploring possible assignments that satisfy all constraints. It includes techniques like backtracking and forward checking to optimize the search.

3. Parsing a Family Tree using a Knowledge Base
Developed a parser to create and traverse a family tree using logical statements in a knowledge base. Queries related to family relationships are answered based on predefined facts and rules.

4. A* Algorithm for an Application
Implemented the A* search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a specific application. The algorithm uses both path cost and heuristic estimates to find the optimal solution.

5. Minimax Algorithm for Game Playing
This program implements the Minimax algorithm for decision-making in a two-player game. The algorithm simulates all possible moves to find the optimal strategy for the AI player.

6. Basic Search Strategies for the 8-Queens Problem
Implemented basic search algorithms to solve the 8-queens problem. The solution ensures no two queens threaten each other on the board.

7. Forward Chaining Algorithm
A forward chaining algorithm is implemented to infer new facts from a given knowledge base. It iteratively applies inference rules to derive conclusions from known facts.

8. Backward Chaining Algorithm
This implementation of the backward chaining algorithm works by starting from a goal and working backward to infer the necessary facts. It is used to determine if a goal can be derived from a set of rules and facts.
